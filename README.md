✨ Introduction

Interactive Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer built with vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript, designed to help developers visually understand how pathfinding algorithms (like Dijkstra’s algorithm) function step-by-step.
Draw walls, drag start/end nodes, generate mazes, and watch the algorithm explore — all in real time with smooth animations.

If you’re learning algorithm fundamentals, improving your frontend skills, or preparing for interviews — this visualizer gives a fun, interactive way to see how algorithms actually work.

⚙️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Semantic web structure and layout.

CSS3 – Modern styles, responsive design, interactive grid animations.

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Core logic for grid generation, event handling, and pathfinding algorithm implementation.
