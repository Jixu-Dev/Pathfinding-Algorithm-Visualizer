🧭 Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

Build and visualize pathfinding algorithms interactively using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project helps you understand how algorithms like Dijkstra’s Algorithm explore grids to find the shortest path between two points — all with smooth animations and a modern UI.

✨ Introduction

The Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web-based project that demonstrates how pathfinding algorithms work internally.

Users can:

Draw walls

Move start & target nodes

Generate random mazes

Watch the algorithm explore the grid step by step

This project is ideal for:

Learning DSA concepts visually

Strengthening JavaScript logic

Showcasing frontend + algorithm skills in your portfolio

⚙️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Semantic structure and layout

CSS3 – Modern dark UI, animations, and responsiveness

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Core logic, grid handling, and algorithm implementation

No frameworks or libraries — pure fundamentals 💪

🔋 Features

👉 Dijkstra’s Algorithm Visualization
Visualize how the shortest path is calculated in real time.

👉 Interactive Grid
Click & drag to create or remove walls dynamically.

👉 Draggable Start & Target Nodes
Move nodes anywhere on the grid before running the algorithm.

👉 Random Maze Generator
Generate random obstacles to test different scenarios.

👉 Smooth Animations

Visited nodes animation

Shortest path highlighting

👉 Responsive Design
Works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

👉 Clean & Modern UI
Dark theme with intuitive controls and legends.

🤸 Quick Start

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

Git (optional, for cloning)

Cloning the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-visualizer.git
cd pathfinding-visualizer

Running the Project

Since this is a pure frontend project, no installation is required.

Just open:

index.html


in your browser
(or use Live Server in VS Code for best experience)
